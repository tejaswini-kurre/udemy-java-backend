Servlet:
-----------
Servlet is responsible for receiving requests from cluent
and sends response back to the client.
Servlets runs on server say Tomcat.

JSP:
-------
JSP stands for Jakarta server pages.
JSP contains both html and java code.
Jsp code is converted to servlet and then runs on (tomcat) server

MVC Architecture
-------------------
Client sends request to controller



to add data from controller to view pages(jsp/jstl):
1. session variable (HttpSession)
2. model attribute (Model)
use anyone of the two types and set the data.
then return jsp page name 

ModelAndView is used to set data and view both into a single object.
then we can directly return that object.


@RequestMapping
------------------
Can be used on both method level and class level
used to create path that can be hit from view.

@RequestParam
------------------
Used as parameter in method level,
to accept request parameters that hit from the view

@modelAttribute
------------------
Similar to model and session attributes but,
no need to explicitly use setAttribute()/addAttrobute() methods to set the data
that can be used in view pages.
This can be used in both method level and parameter level.
