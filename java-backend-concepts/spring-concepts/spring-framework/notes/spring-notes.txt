what is spring?
------------------
spring is a framework to create applications in java.
spring is a light weight framework
spring works on POJOs(Plan old java objects).


IOC(Inversion of Control) and DI(dependency injction):
--------------------------------------------------------
spring contains IOC conatiner to create objects.
These objects can be used in the programs using dependency injection.

different types of object creation in spring
----------------------------------------------
1. xml configuration
2. java based configuration
3. annotation based configuration

Object creation in xml configuration
---------------------------------------
In spring objects are called beans.
these beans are stored in IOC container.
IOC container is maintained by Application context.
objecta/beans are created by ApplicationContext.
we have to provide xml file which contains all java class related bean creation information into this ClassPathXmlApplicationContext constructor
In xml file, bean tag, we provide id,class,scope of a java class.
scope is of two types: 1.singleton, 2.prototype
singleton scope creates only one object of the specified class in Application context is created.
prototype scope creates multiple objects every time getBean() method is called.
by default scope is singleton.

constructor injection in xml configuration
----------------------------------------------
<property> tag is used to add values to the class variables by calling setter method.
<constructor-args> tag is used to call parameterised constructor of that class which passes required parameters.

different types of dependency injection in java based configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. field based injection
2. constructor based injection
3. setter based injection

preference between @Qualifier and @Primary in java based configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
first preference @Qualifier
second preference @Primary
