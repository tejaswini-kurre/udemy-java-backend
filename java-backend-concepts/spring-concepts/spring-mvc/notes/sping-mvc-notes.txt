How spring works behind the scenes for spring-webmvc library.
(use eclipse)

Add external tomcat
Create Controller file and view files(jsp).

web.xml contains omcat configuration.
DispatcherServlet is used to tell tomcat to call it for the very first time for all the paths.


next we have to configure DispatcherServlet.(there will be another .xml file with project name as file name)
In that we have to configure:
component-scan 
annotation config
For any views to call we can add prefix and suffix extensions using InternalResourceViewResolver.
(just like adding properties in application.properties files in spirng-boot)
