What is maven:
----------------
maven is a project management tool.
It is used to perform all project lifecycle stages such as compile, run, test, packaging and deploying.
It is used to add/manage dependencies of the project in pom.xml file(project object model).

How maven works:
-------------------
When a dependency is added in pom.xml file
maven first checks whether the jar file is present in local or not.
if it is present it will pick, else
it connects to maven repository and download the required dependency along with transistant dependency.

Effective POM:
--------------------
it is hidden by default.
it contains default settings and configuration of our application
